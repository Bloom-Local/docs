# Contribution


## Contributing to Ergonode code

Contributions to the Ergonode codebase are done using the fork & pull model.
This contribution model has contributors maintaining their own copy of the forked codebase (which can easily be synced with the main copy). The forked repository is then used to submit a request to the base repository to “pull” a set of changes.

Contributions can take the form of new components or features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes or optimizations.

The Ergonode development team will review all issues and contributions submitted by the community of developers in the first in, first out order. During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor.

### Contribution requirements

1. Contributions must adhere to the **Coding standards**.

2. Pull requests (PRs) must be accompanied by a meaningful description of their purpose. Comprehensive descriptions increase the chances of a pull request being merged quickly and without additional clarification requests. Description can be delivered as an issue linked to PR.

3. PRs which include bug fixes must be accompanied with a step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug. This also can be delivered as a linked issue.

4. PRs which include new logic or new features must be submitted along with:
    
    a. Unit/integration test coverage (to be described)

    b. PRD - Product Requirement Document that contains all necessary background of purpose and proposed implementations.

5. For larger features or changes, please consider opening an issue to discuss the proposed changes prior to development. This may prevent duplicate or unnecessary effort and allow other contributors to provide input.

### Contribution process

1. Search current **product requirements** and **listed issues** (open or closed) for similar proposals of intended contribution before starting work on a new contribution.

2. Fork the Ergonode repository.

3. Create and test your work.

4. When you are ready send a pull request.

5. Once your contribution is received the Ergonode development team will review the contribution and collaborate with you as needed.

### Code of Conduct

**Our Pledge**

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

**Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

**Our Responsibilities**

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

**Enforcement**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the **project maintainers**. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
