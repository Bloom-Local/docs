## Vue.js

For building whole frontend part of Ergonode aplication we use Vue.js

Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

## Vuex

For state management Ergonode use Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official devtools extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.
